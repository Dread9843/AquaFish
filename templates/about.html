                 for recognizing fish species based on aquarium fish photos. As a result of the project's basic 
                 activities, 7 different aquarium fish species are classified.Â  Our "AquaFish" model can scientifically predict fish. 
                 The web application will output the scientific name of the aquarium fish species as a result. Apart from the system, 
                 if time allows, we will add or ensure that it is capable of switching to a VGG16 pre-train model that can be tweaked to 
                 fit our datasets and can predict aquarium fish species names by taking photos. It has the potential to significantly reduce the 
                 time-consuming chore of the fish merchant, keeper, and fish enthusiast.Let's have a look at the features of the "AquaFish" image recognition model, 
                 which are described below.</p>
